Using the information provided by the user about a new client and their business requirements can you use this JSON template, which shows an example of another business, to generate a new JSON file.
Each field should be filled.
Any information that is unknown just put NULL. 
This is a template make sure the titles are consistent.
For the Requirements tale - the InteractionsID table the RawText is simply the user prompt for example the whole transcript of a conversation or the whole email. The ExtractedSummary should be a summary of the raw text. This applies to the Constraints table as well. This is a template and can be expanded accordingly such as if more Requirements, Constraints or ProjectTechnology needs to be added.
